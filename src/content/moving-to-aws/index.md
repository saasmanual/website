The year is coming to an end, and wow, what a strange year. Time flew, yet the world stood still in many ways. First of all, I hope you are well and that you managed to get through 2020 without too many bruises. In this weeks post, I will share more context on how I migrated the SaaS Manual website to AWS. And here's the news: It is done ðŸŽ‰ Before diving in though, let me share what's new:

## What's New

**Generator updates:** I added small updates to the site generator which we built [in the last post](/2020-11-18-Reinventing-The-Wheel-d3e0460b52784c94938db5cf0e67ee43). You can now write draft posts without those being published to the website. This was a request by Luca Cipriani.

**Discord community:** This is not exactly new, but since there is such an awesome community happening, I am sharing it again: [Join the SaaS Manual community here](https://discord.gg/wHtewNG).

## SaaS Manual on AWS

I launched [SaaS Manual on Notion](/2020-11-03-Building-a-website-on-Notion-bf98c2cb108e4370b291b375b377eb18), because it was the fastest way I could validate the idea. After the launch and more than 500 signups to the email list, I decided to invest some time into building the new SaaS Manual website, the foundation for this course. Let me dive into some of the details of what I did to make this happen:

## Infrastructure

There are many ways you can host a new website. You might decide to use a cloud platform for serverleess deployment like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), you might host on a CMS like [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) or [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). Instead of building on top of these platforms I will show you how to do this on AWS. This means that we will go a little bit lower level than these platforms. This because I would love to show you what happens under the hood for many of the SaaS products you are using. Let's dive into the infrastructure setup. 

The current [SaaS Manual website](https://saasmanual.com) is still pretty simple, there is a landing page and there are a bunch of articles. We have an email list signup form, some metrics and that is pretty much all there is to it at this point. 

This is the perfect time to run you through the "journey" the code makes from being written to being visible to a visitor on SaaS Manual. 

## Local development

I am developing SaaS Manual on my laptop. This means that I can have a fast iteration cycle between making changes and verifying that those changes are working correctly. As we are increasingly moving into the cloud you can also setup your entire development environment in the cloud. If you are curious about that, I can recommend checking out some of the cloud environments, like [Cloud9](https://c9.io). For my requirements, my laptop works really well.

Usually, I setup one directory for all repositories related to one project. In my case the directory is `~/dev/saasmanual`. 

![/assets/img/posts/moving-to-aws/local-setup.png](/assets/img/posts/moving-to-aws/local-setup.png)

In there, you see I cloned a few GitHub repositories. The `website` repo being the selected one. I usually open a termial session with a few terminals running. In this case, the main session is the one which I use to start the local process which runs a lightweight server on my machine. Let's try this out, simply run the following commands in a new terminal session:

```
git clone https://github.com/saasmanual/website.git
cd website
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should see similar terminal output as the one below:

![/assets/img/posts/moving-to-aws/local-terminal.png](/assets/img/posts/moving-to-aws/local-terminal.png)

If that is the case, you can now preview the website by accessing [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001) ðŸŽ‰. 
Now when we make changes, like writing a new post, I eventually commit the changes to Git and push them to GitHub. Full and updated instructions can be found in the file README.md.

## Deploying to production

And this is where a lot of the magic happens: When I push a change to GitHub, on the `main` branch, CodePipeline, an AWS service which helps you automate deployments, picks up the change. It triggers another service, CodeBuild to create what is called a `deployment artifact`. CodeBuild clones the repository, runs a few commands like `npm ci` and `npm run build`. CodeBuild then creates a ZIP, uploads the files which just were built to S3 so that CodePipeline can for instance deploy this artifact to a public S3 bucket. As the last step, CodePipeline does exactly do this, it deploys the artifact to S3. Now our latest version of SaaS Manual is live. 

I kept the flow deliberately high level, because it is important to first understand the concept of a pipeline and the different steps within.

![/assets/img/posts/moving-to-aws/codepipeline.png](/assets/img/posts/moving-to-aws/codepipeline.png)

A pipeline is basically an orchestration software which you can "program". You can say things like: First, I'd like you to check out this repository. When this succeeds, please run a few tests. You also can tell it that a human needs to approve something. Then after everything succeeded, the pipeline instructs a deployment mechanism to deploy your code. To simplify it, a pipeline is a step by step instruction set of actions on an input producing some output at the end of the process.

You might wonder, that's cool, but how do I set this up myself? This is where the AWS **C**loud **D**evelopment **K**it (CDK) comes into play. The CDK allows you to define infrastructure as code (IaC). This is a important piece of the puzzle! In the past, you would log into the AWS console, and press a bunch of buttons, setting up the right tools... hopefully. It would be impossible to recreate the same environment without huge pain. When your service grew, you might have moved to CloudFormation to write complicated JSON or YAML files. So that you at least would be able to check your YAML files into a repo and apply source control. This still is quite painful if you ask me. CDK to the rescue. Now you can do cool stuff like this:

```
const websiteAssets = new S3.Bucket(this, `website-production-assets`, {
  accessControl: BucketAccessControl.PUBLIC_READ,
  bucketName: `saas-manual-website-prod-static-assets`,
  publicReadAccess: true,
  websiteIndexDocument: 'index.html',
  websiteErrorDocument: '404/index.html'
});
```

I won't even explain what this does, because I am willing to bet that you can read this and understand what it does. With the CDK, you are now able to define your entire infrastructure and your deployment and testing infrastructure through code. This is how I did it:

### Shared infrastructure

Everything which I expect to be shared between services lives in a [shared infrastructure repository](https://github.com/saasmanual/shared-infrastructure). 
This includes the Route53 setup for instance. Imagine at some point there will be a SaaS Manual API next to the website. Both API and website probably will use the same Route53 setup. That is why I have a dedicated setup for this. Here is how you setup a new hosted zone and a certificate using the CDK, it is basically awesome:

```
const zone = new PublicHostedZone(this, 'hosted-zone', {
  zoneName: domainName
});

new DnsValidatedCertificate(this, 'certificate', {
  domainName,
  subjectAlternativeNames: [certificateAlternativeNames],
  hostedZone: zone
});
```

Have a look at the entire repository, maybe [start from here](https://github.com/saasmanual/shared-infrastructure/blob/main/bin/pipeline.js).

### SaaS Manual Website

Everything which is specific to the SaaS Manual website lives in the [website repository](https://github.com/saasmanual/website). The required infrastructure for the website is located in the `infra` folder. And the source for the website itself in the `src` directory. Here the interesting part really is the setup of the pipeline which I described earlier. The CDK has a "construct" which allows you to setup a pipeline with just a few lines of code. 

```
const pipeline = new CdkPipeline(this, 'Website', {
  pipelineName: 'Website',
  cloudAssemblyArtifact,

  sourceAction: new GitHubSourceAction({
    // Removed to keep it brief.
  }),

  synthAction: SimpleSynthAction.standardNpmSynth({
    sourceArtifact,
    cloudAssemblyArtifact,
    buildCommand: 'npm run build',
  })
});
```

There is a tiny bit more detail to it, all you need to do really is to read the source in the `infra` directory. 

## UX / Layout

Now that we had the infrastruture setup and that we could deploy a static site to AWS, it was time to do some styling and make the new site look good.
As I described in [a previous post](/2020-11-18-Reinventing-The-Wheel-d3e0460b52784c94938db5cf0e67ee43), I am using a very basic site generator to generate HTML pages based on Markdown content. So all I had to do is style the HTML templates. I am using a CSS toolkit called [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com). I love Tailwind, because it allows me to move fast, and it is fairly simple to learn. I also am using [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com). I still had a license for another project.

## Markdown Plugins

There were a few things I wanted to be able to do, which were not natively supported in Markdown. Here is the curren list:

* Generating the TOC on the landing page.
* Having a floating image.
* Embedding of the email signup iframe.

The site generator I built is using a powerful Markdown processor called [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark). Remark allows you to write custom plugins. 
I might dive into this in another post, if there is interest, for now, you can find all Markdown plugins which I specifically built for SaaS Manuale in the [src/lib](https://github.com/saasmanual/website/tree/main/src/lib) directory.
