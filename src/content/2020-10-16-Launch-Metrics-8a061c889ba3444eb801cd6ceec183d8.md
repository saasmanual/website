# Launch Metrics

Wow, it's been a super cool day yesterday 🙏🏻. I announced [SaaS Manual on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/saas-manual) without a ton of expectations and the response has been amazing. 

Before diving into the metrics though, have a look at the picture above. I took this yesterday evening at the sea in The Netherlands, just too good 🌊☀️. And if you haven't joined the journey yet, here you go:

Now let's dive in. In the spirit of being fully transparent about the process of building SaaS Manual into a fully-fledged product, let me share the metrics I have so far:

## Email signups

**294 folks 🚀** have signed up to the SaaS Manual list (as of writing). 294 folks who are curious about how to build SaaS products. Welcome each and everybody. I am super happy you joined this adventure.

## Website visits

Between yesterday and today, **1.1k individuals** 👩🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻 have visited the SaaS Manual website. Whoop whoop and most came from the Product Hunt announcement. While I don't have any conversion tracking setup, this means that ~**25% of the visitors joined the journey**, wow!!! You can dive into the metrics here: [https://plausible.io/saasmanual.com](https://plausible.io/saasmanual.com)

## Product Hunt

SaaS Manual made it to **#9** on [yesterdays launch day 🎉🙏🏻](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/saas-manual). It hovered around **#8** for a long time even. Nothing what I expected and I am super happy about this. As of now, **225 folks** voted for SaaS Manual, thank you all ❤️.

## Twitter, Reddit and Indie Hackers

I shared the announcement on Twitter and gained **18** new followers on [my personal account](https://twitter.com/nonken). The [SaaS Manual account](https://twitter.com/saasmanual) has 9 followers. Hi wonderful people 👋🏻. I also posted the announcement on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/jbllkb/saas_manual_learn_how_to_build_software_as_a/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/jbl6ii/saas_manual_building_products_on_aws/) Reddit thread and [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/saas-manual/saas-manual-on-product-hunt--MJfGJ99xLmveFjalwM3). 

## What's next?

I am planning to share [https://saasmanual.com](https://saasmanual.com) on Hacker News coming Tuesday (October 20th, 2020) as the last bigger push to get the word out. After that, I will exclusively focus on actual lesson content. 

The first lesson will be how to build a product landing page on Notion (this is what https://saasmanual.com) currently is and it works amazingly well right now. I'll share the tools I am using, like Cloudflare, Notion, etc. which helped me get started with this.

Take care and until the next update!
